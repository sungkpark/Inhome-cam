# Version label

During debug and QA it's important to know the _exact_ version of the App that's being tested.

To facilitate this the SDK contains a built-in **Version Label** that can be turned on or off via the [Platform Setting](/plugins/settings?id=platform) `showVersion` in `settings.json`.

When enabled an unubtrusive label with the App version as specified in `metadata.json` and the Lightning-SDK version will be displayed as an overlay in the bottom right corner of the App.
