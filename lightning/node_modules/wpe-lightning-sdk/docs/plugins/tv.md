# TV

The TV plugin serves as an abstraction layer to the _live TV_ functionality of a STB. The interface gives you access to the current channel
and program information, and allows you to change the TV channel from inside an App (if your app is _whitelisted_ to do so).

With the TV plugin you can adapt your App _contextually_ to what the user is currently watching on TV.

## Usage

In order to use the TV plugin, import it from the Lightning SDK.

```js
import { TV } from 'wpe-lightning-sdk'
```

## Available methods

### Channel

Either _retrieves_ information about the TV channel that is _currently_ being watched or _changes_ the current TV channel.

#### Retrieve current Channel

```js
TV.channel().then(channel => console.log(channel))
```

The `channel`-method returns a _promise_ which returns the channel information as an object.

During _development_ the `channel`-method returns a random mocked channel. Optionally you can [overwrite](#overwriting-default-values) the default values.

```js
{
  number: 1,
  name: 'Metro News 1',
  description: 'New York Cable News Channel',
  entitled: true,
}
```

#### Change current channel

```js
const channelNumber = 2
TV.channel(channelNumber).then(channel => console.log(channel))
```

When a channelNumber is passed as an argument to the `channel`-method it will try to change the TV channel.
It will return a _promise_ which returns the channel information as an object.

During _development_ you can pass either `1`, `2`, or `3` as a `channelNumber`, to select one of the default mocked channels.

Please note, that in a _production_ setting most Apps will **not** be able to change the current Live TV Channel. The functionality is only
made available to certain _whitelisted_ Apps.

### Program

Retrieves the information about the TV program that is currently being watched.

```js
TV.program().then(program => console.log(program))
```

The `program`-method returns a _promise_ which returns program information as an object.

During _development_ the `program`-method returns a mocked program, linked to a random mocked channel. Optionally you can [overwrite](#overwriting-default-values) the default values.

```js
{
  title: 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon',
  description: 'Late-night talk show hosted by Jimmy Fallon on NBC',
  startTime: 'Wed, 12 Aug 2020 23:00:00 GMT', // UTC date string
  duration: 3600, // in seconds
  ageRating: 10,
}
```

### Entitled

Retrieves if the user is entitled to watch the current TV channel.

```js
TV.entitled().then(entitled => console.log(entitled))
```

The `entitled`-method returns a _promise_ which returns `true` when the user is entitled and `false` when not.

During _development_ the `entitled`-method returns the entitlement value of the random mocked channel. Optionally you can [overwrite](#overwriting-default-values) the default values.

### AddEventListener

The `addEventListener`-method allows you to listen for TV events, and execute a callback when they happen.

```js
const event = 'channelChange'
const callback = (channel) => { console.log(channel) }

TV.addEventListener(event, callback)
```

Currently only 1 event is supported (`channelChange`). It will pass an object with the new `channel` information as an argument to the callback function.
It's possible to register multiple callbacks for the same event.

### RemoveEventListener

The `removeEventListener`-method allows you to remove previously registerd callbacks for TV events (via the `addEventListener`-method).

```js
const event = 'channelChange'
const callback = (channel) => { console.log(channel) }

TV.removeEventListener(event, callback)
```

When the `callback` argument is ommitted, all previously registered callbacks for that event will be removed.


## Overwriting default values

During development you might want to test your App with different TV channels and / or programs.
When you want to overwrite the default values, you can do so by editing the `settings.json` file.
Add a `tv` key in `platformSettings` and supply it with an `Array` of channels in the following format:

```json
{
  "platformSettings": {
    "tv": [
      {
        "number": 1,
        "name": "Metro News 1",
        "description": "New York Cable News Channel",
        "entitled": true,
        "program": {
          "title": "The Morning Show",
          "description": "New York's best morning show",
          "startTime":  "Wed, 12 Aug 2020 23:00:00 GMT",
          "duration": 180,
          "ageRating": 0
        }
      },
      ...
    ]
   }
}
 ```
