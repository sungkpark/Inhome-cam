# Settings

An App created with the SDK can be configured with various options. These can either be _App_ or _Platform_ specific settings.

During development you can configure your own settings in `settings.json` to simulate different environments:

```json
{
    "appSettings": {
        "stage": {
            "clearColor": "0x00000000",
            "useImageWorker": true
        },
        "debug": true
    },
    "platformSettings": {
        "path": "./static",
        "log": true,
        "showVersion": true
    }
}
```

Be aware that when your App is deployed to the App Store the settings are configured in the Store dashboard and can vary per operator and platform.

## Usage

Most settings are automatically handled by the SDK.But sometimes you may want to access settings in your App code directly. In those cases you can import the _Settings plugin_ from the Lightning SDK.

The SDK automatically creates the `app` or `platform` types from the Launch params.

Optionally you might want to specify _user defined_ settings at runtime, that can be accessed anywhere in your App. For these cases the `user` type is used.

```js
import { Settings } from 'wpe-lightning-sdk'
```

## Available methods

### Get

Returns a settings value.

```js
Settings.get(type, key, [fallback])
```

Type can be either `app`, `platform` or `user`. Key can be any of the existing settings.
Optionally you can specify a `fallback`-value for when the setting is not defined.

### Set

Sets a key, value on `user` type for _user defined settings_

```js
Settings.set(key, value)
```

### Has

Returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether a setting is defined or not.

```js
Settings.has(type, key)
```

### Subscribe

Adds a callback to be notified when the value of a `user` key is changed. Multiple callbacks can be added for the same key.

```js
Settings.subscribe(key, callback)
```

The callback receives the setting's `value` as an argument.

### Unsubscribe

Removes callback(s) from the notification stack for a specific `user` key.

```js
Settings.unsubscribe(key, [callback])
```

When a reference to a previously subscribed callback is passed it will remove only that callback.
If the optional callback param is omitted it will pop all callbacks for the given key.

### clearSubscribers

Clears _all_ subscribers listening for `user` key changes. This method is automatically called when the App is closed for to prevent _memory leaks_.

```js
Settings.clearSubscribers()
```
